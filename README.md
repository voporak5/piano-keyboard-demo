# Piano Demo with Object Pooling

This is a demo using object pooling to create a piano that can play sound effects from
the keyboard

I modified what I learned from my Architecture of Realtime Systems class at DePaul
about object pooling and applied it into Unity
## Acknowledgements

Thanks Patrick for recording some piano sounds for the whole world to use freely.
Acknowledgement was not necessary but I felt it was deserved.
